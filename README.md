load texthost.dll generated by this repo

put x86 texthook.dll in application's root folder

if you see OutputHandle give "Textractor: initialization completed" this sentence only, it may be texthook.dll is not being loaded properly

for use both x64 x86 texthook.dll, see branch x86

the branch x86 build texthost at x86 architecture. This cause the application must target to x86 at all.
